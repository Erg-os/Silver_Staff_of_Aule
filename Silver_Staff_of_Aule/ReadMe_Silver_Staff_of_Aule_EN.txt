Description:
This mod adds the silver and cold iron properties, and a bonus to damage
and thac0 vs. lycanthropes, to the Aule's Staff which is sold at the store
in the Ulgoth's Beard Inn, providing an additional weapon able to damage
the Greater Wolfwere (Karoug). For balancing reasons, the staff's price has
been increased from 5500 to 7500 gold (base price, actual price as usual
will depend on reputation and charisma). The staff icons and colours have
been changed to make it look more like silver.

An attempt is made to update the in-game description for the staff, but it
may fail if the description has been substantially altered by another mod,
or an official BG:EE update. In this case the description will be entirely
replaced by a new one instead. You will be notified during mod installation
if this happens.

NOTE for BGT:
BGT replaces the Aule's Staff with the Martial Staff. Therefore, this mod
puts back the Aule's Staff in the Ulgoth's Inn, but does not alter other
instances of the Martial Staff. Please note that in BGT, unlike other BG
versions, it is required to start a new game for this mod to work, if you
have already browsed the items in the Ulgoth's Inn store. As a workaround
for ongoing games, it is possible to use the CLUA console to get the staff.

Item Codes for the CLUA Console:
This mod uses the following item codes for the Aule's Staff:

STAF08   (BG:EE and vanilla TotSC)
_STAF08  (Tutu TotSC only)
ER_STA08 (BGT only)
